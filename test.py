To model the given scenario in a Qlik Sense data model, we can create a star schema with a fact table and three dimension tables. Here's how you can approach it:

Fact Table: ServerClusterComponent

This table will contain the numerical measures or metrics related to the servers, clusters, and components.
Possible fields: ServerID, ClusterID, ComponentID, Metric1, Metric2, etc.
Dimension Table: Servers

This table will contain information about the servers.
Possible fields: ServerID (primary key), ServerName, ServerDescription, etc.
Dimension Table: Clusters

This table will contain information about the clusters.
Possible fields: ClusterID (primary key), ClusterName, ClusterDescription, etc.
Dimension Table: Components

This table will contain information about the components (A, B, C).
Possible fields: ComponentID (primary key), ComponentName, ComponentDescription, etc.
To establish the relationships between these tables, you'll need to create associations in Qlik Sense:

Association between ServerClusterComponent and Servers:

Link the ServerID field in the ServerClusterComponent table to the ServerID field in the Servers table.
Association between ServerClusterComponent and Clusters:

Link the ClusterID field in the ServerClusterComponent table to the ClusterID field in the Clusters table.
Association between ServerClusterComponent and Components:

Link the ComponentID field in the ServerClusterComponent table to the ComponentID field in the Components table.
With these associations, you can create a star schema data model in Qlik Sense, where the ServerClusterComponent table is the central fact table, and the Servers, Clusters, and Components tables are the dimension tables.

Here's a visual representation of the data model:
ServerClusterComponent (Fact Table)
- ServerID
- ClusterID
- ComponentID
- Metric1
- Metric2
- ...

Servers (Dimension Table)
- ServerID (Primary Key)
- ServerName
- ServerDescription
- ...

Clusters (Dimension Table)
- ClusterID (Primary Key)
- ClusterName
- ClusterDescription
- ...

Components (Dimension Table)
- ComponentID (Primary Key)
- ComponentName
- ComponentDescription
- ...
